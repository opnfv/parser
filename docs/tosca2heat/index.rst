TOSCA To Heat Documents
****************

This is the directory to store documents regarding tosca to heat translation. 

The "parser_new_keywords" document demonstrate a set of keywords concluded by Parser team that need to be supported in tosca to heat translation. However it should be noted that these keywords only serve as a roadmap. We will start from Release C to indicate which specific set of keywords are supported in Parser.

The "vRNC_tosca_intro" document describes Parser's use case analysis on vRNC scenario.

The "example" folder contains examples of tosca-nfv standard and vRNC scenario.
