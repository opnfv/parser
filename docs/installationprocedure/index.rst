Parser Configuration and Configuration Guide
********************************************
Parser is an open source project and licensed under Apache 2. Parser will help
to provide a tooling mechanism, by parsing and then further translating Telecom
operators deployment descriptors into certain common templates, which could be
used in IaaS orchestration projects like OpenStack Heat(the template file is HOT,
which stands for Heat Orchestrator Template).

This document contains configuration guide for Parser's three submodules: tosca2heat,
yang2tosca and policy2tosca. Users please refer to user guide for installation and execution
which usually happens after configuration.
