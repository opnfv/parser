Introduction of Parser Project
==============================

In NFV, various templates (such as descriptors, records and so on) are utilized
to describe the deployment requirements (such as basic VM requirements – vCPU,
memory, storage, as well as the NFV acceleration management requirement such as
Huge Pages support, SR-IOV, NUMA affinity, DPDK support etc.),
the post-instaniation records (such as storage usage report, CPU performance
report etc.) or other purposes. However in order to make these templates
adaptable and feasible for purpose like deployment orchestration/automation,
certain tooling mechanism that provides template translation is necessary.

Project Parser will help to provide such tooling mechanism, by parsing Telecom
operators’ descriptors/records into TOSCA/CAMP templates and then further
translate TOSCA/CAMP templates into certain common templates, which could be
used in IaaS orchestration projects like OpenStack Heat.

For Release B, Parser offers the following capabilities:

* Integration of Heat-Translator Liberty release code. (both heat in-tree code and standalone package are provided)

* Yang2Tosca module which offers the capability to translate yang based
  scriptors to tosca formate templates. Users could further use Heat-translator
  module to translate this tosca template to Heat Orchestration template.
  Yang2Tosca module could be installed seperately after user installed
  OPNFV B release platform.

* The "parser_new_keywords" document demonstrate a set of keywords concluded by
  Parser team that need to be supported in tosca to heat translation. However
  it should be noted that these keywords only serve as a roadmap. We will start
  from Release C to indicate which specific set of keywords are supported in
  Parser.

* The "vRNC_tosca_intro" document describes Parser's use case analysis on vRNC scenario.
  The "example" folder contains examples of tosca-nfv standard and vRNC scenario.

For Release C, Parser offers additional capabilities:

* Policy2Tosca module which enables policy related fields in tosca could be translated 
  into heat orchestration template correctly. Policy2Tosca module could be installed seperately
  after user installed OPNFV C release platform.

* Tosca2Heat enhancements which includes a set of feature addons for OpenStack tosca-parser module
  which is integrated in the OPNFV C release platform.

* Additional testing support.
