Hi Guys,

主题: Parser Committer Promotion Guidline call for approval from comitters 
 
Hi everyone, 
  
Since I received only one comment from Julien so far on the cap of committer number, I updated the slide to address Juline’s comment and call for your approval. Please reply +1 if you are ok with our non-mandatory additional guideline, or specify your concerns if you have doubts about the current version. 
  
As I discussed in the previous meetings, after the slide (i.e the “Motion”) got unanimous +1 approval, I will submit it to our Parser repo so that it becomes a public document. Any further changes to the document should be done in a similar way: PTL or committer initiate a motion via email, and after committer approval submit it to parser repo, and merge after all the concerns addressed (all the -1 comments) 
  
This first document will be merged after the consent from you guys tho, since this is the starting piece. 
  
I will also show the record of the committer voting for openness and publicity. 
  
 
Best Regards
