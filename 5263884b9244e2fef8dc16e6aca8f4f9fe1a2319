I don\u0027t know if one set of terms is preferred over the other, or if the concept is described in some standards document that should be reflected here.  I\u0027m not asking for anything to change, just noting that there may be other terms used to describe the same concepts.",

      "message": "HI,Bob,thanks for reviewing.\nYou are right, as far as i known, affinity and antiaffinity are called in computer host schedule filter in openstack, but in simple tosca standard they are called colocate and antilocate in example, that\u0027s why i call them here. In general,I think affility/antiaffility will be more appropriate than colocate/antilocate.",
