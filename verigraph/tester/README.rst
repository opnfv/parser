In order to run the automatic testing script test.py, you need the
following dependencies installed on your python distribution:

-  "requests" python package ->
   http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/
-  "jsonschema" python package ->
   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jsonschema

IMPORTANT - If you have multiple versions of Python installed on your
machine, check carefully that the version you are actually using when
running the script, has the required packages installed. Requested
version is Python 3+

| HINT - to install a package you can raise the following command (Bash
  on Linux or DOS shell on Windows):
| python -m pip install jsonschema
| python -m pip install requests

Tested on PYTHON 3.4.3

To add a new test, just put a new .json file inside the testcases
folder. The corresponding JSON schema is in the testcase\_schema.json
file and some examples are already available. Each json file should
specify:

-  id, an integer for the testcase;
-  name, the name for the testcase;
-  description, an optional description;
-  policy\_url\_parameters, the parameters to be appended after the
   verification URL (including the '?' character);
-  result, the expected verification result;
-  graph, the graph to be tested (the same object that you usually POST
   to VeriGraph to create a new graph).
   The test.py script will test each .json file contained into the
   testcases folder and will provide a complete output.
